/**
 * @title IAlignmentVault
 * @notice Standard interface for alignment vaults compatible with ms2fun ecosystem
 * @dev All vaults must implement this interface to be approved by governance
 *
 * Design Philosophy:
 * - Vaults receive alignment taxes from project instances
 * - Vaults track contributors as "benefactors" and issue proportional shares
 * - Benefactors can claim accumulated fees based on their share percentage
 * - Vaults are responsible for yield generation strategy (V4 LP, Aave, Curve, etc.)
 * - Instances remain vault-agnostic and interact only via this interface
 *
 * Compliance Requirements:
 * 1. Must accept ETH via receiveContribution() and receive()
 * 2. Must track benefactor contributions and issue shares
 * 3. Must allow benefactors to claim proportional fees
 * 4. Must emit standard events for transparency
 * 5. Must declare vaultType() for governance classification
