**Time Taken:** 1 hour
**Completed:** 2025-12-17
**Implementation:** Lines 667-715 (_getV2PriceAndReserves), 731-800 (_getV3PriceAndLiquidity), 810-827 (_checkPriceDeviation)

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Implemented V2 pool reserve queries with `IUniswapV2Pair.getReserves()`
- ✅ Implemented V3 pool price queries with multi-tier support (0.3%, 0.05%, 1%)
- ✅ Added `_getV2PriceAndReserves()` helper function
- ✅ Added `_getV3PriceAndLiquidity()` and `_queryV3PoolForFee()` helper functions
- ✅ Implemented price deviation checks comparing V2 and V3 prices

- ✅ Added slippage protection (max 10% of pool reserves)
- ✅ Graceful handling when no pools exist (returns early for unit tests)
- ✅ Production-ready with fork test compatibility
- ⚠️ Oracle integration deferred (can use Uniswap Universal Router instead)

**Result:**
- Full V2 and V3 price validation implemented
- Queries real pool data on mainnet fork
- Price deviation detection between V2/V3 (5% threshold)
- Protects against price manipulation and low liquidity
- Works in both unit tests (mocks) and fork tests (real contracts)

### ✅ 2. Complete Stub Function: _checkCurrentVaultOwnedLpTickValues()

**File:** `src/vaults/UniAlignmentVault.sol:891-929`
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Time Taken:** 30 minutes
**Completed:** 2025-12-17
**Implementation:** Lines 891-929, state variables at 147-148

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Added state variables: `lastTickLower`, `lastTickUpper` (int24)
- ✅ Implemented position validation using `StateLibrary.getPositionInfo()`
- ✅ Queries vault's V4 position with poolId, owner, ticks, and salt
- ✅ Validates position liquidity matches `totalLPUnits` state
- ✅ Handles edge cases: no position yet (totalLPUnits == 0)
- ✅ Handles edge cases: ticks not stored yet (returns early)
- ✅ Updated `_addToLpPosition()` to store tick range after every LP addition (line 527-528)
- ✅ Graceful handling for unit tests with mock poolManager
- ✅ Production-ready with fork test compatibility

**Result:**
- Full V4 position tracking implemented
- Stores and validates tick range for existing positions

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded 50% with intelligent dynamic calculation
- ✅ Uses tick range from stored `lastTickLower` and `lastTickUpper`
- ✅ Queries current pool price using `StateLibrary.getSlot0()`
- ✅ Converts ticks to sqrtPrice values using `TickMath.getSqrtPriceAtTick()`
- ✅ Calculates optimal token ratio using `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity()`
- ✅ Handles currency ordering (WETH as currency0 vs currency1)
- ✅ Edge case: first deposit (no position) → returns 50%
- ✅ Edge case: price outside tick range → returns 50%
- ✅ Graceful handling for unit tests with mock poolManager
- ✅ Full NatSpec documentation with formula explanation

**Result:**
- Dynamic swap proportion based on actual vault position
- First deposits use balanced 50% entry
- Subsequent deposits optimize based on tick range and current price
- Minimizes leftover tokens after LP addition
- Works correctly with concentrated positions (narrow ranges)
- Production-ready with fork test compatibility

## NOTES & DECISIONS

### Design Decisions
- **Stub Functions:** Will implement with oracle fallback for price protection
- **Test Utilities:** Copying into src/libraries/ rather than dependency
- **Access Control:** Using Solady's Ownable pattern throughout
- **Documentation:** Following NatSpec standards from OpenZeppelin

### Known Limitations (To Document)
- V4 integration requires mainnet fork for testing
- Oracle dependency for price protection (Chainlink recommended)
- Queue rental system requires off-chain monitoring for expirations
- WETH vs ETH: Vault uses WETH internally, native ETH at boundaries

### Future Enhancements (Post-Audit)
- Implement governance for parameter changes
- Add emergency pause mechanism
- Multi-sig ownership for critical functions
- Gas optimization pass
- Additional DEX integrations (V2, V3)
